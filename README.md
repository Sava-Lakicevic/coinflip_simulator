Simulates a game between players where they flip coins for $1 each time. Game is over when one person has all the money.
Jordan Peterson talked in a podcast about how in a random system, people that start with equal amounts of money, one
person in the end will end up will all of the money, like in Monopoly. Here I model people playing "heads or tails",
all starting with an equal amount of money ($10), playing with each other. The point is to see the amount of time it
takes for one person to end up with all of the money
