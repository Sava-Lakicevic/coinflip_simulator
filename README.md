# coinflip_simulator
Simulates a game between players where they flip coins for $1 each time. Game is over when one person has all the money.

In a group one people that start with equal amounts of money, one person in the end will end up will all of the money, like in Monopoly. Here I model people playing "heads or tails", all starting with an equal amount of money ($10), playing with each other. The point is to see the amount of time it takes for one person to end up with all of the money and to display the phenomenon of one person having all of the money in a "fair system".
